### About Me

I am an AI Scientist with a decade of experience leading teams and transforming complex business challenges into high-impact AI solutions. My passion lies in managing the full lifecycle of Machine Learning models, from **research and fine-tuning of LLMs/ASR/multi-modal models** to their robust deployment and monitoring.

After leading key projects and driving significant improvements in quality and efficiency at **Electronic Arts**, I am now actively seeking a senior role as a **Data Scientist, ML Engineer, or Researcher**. I am looking for a team where I can apply my technical vision and hands-on experience to build the next generation of AI products.

### Awards & Recognitions  
- **ðŸ¥‰ Bronze Medal**, 2022 [Spanish NLP Hackathon](https://somosnlp.org/blog/hackathon-2022)
  - Innovation: Developed a novel T5-based architecture for gender-neutral Spanish text generation, addressing linguistic bias in generative AI.
  - Technical Approach: Fine-tuned T5 with custom tokenization and contextual alignment to preserve semantic coherence while removing gender markers.
  - Validation: Designed evaluation metrics for gender neutrality and fluency, outperforming baseline models by 22% (human eval).
  - Role: Led end-to-end research, from experimental design to final submission.
