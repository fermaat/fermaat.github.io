### About Me

I am a Data Science Team Lead with a decade of experience transforming business challenges into high-impact AI solutions. My specialty is managing the full lifecycle of Machine Learning models, from research and fine-tuning of LLMs/ASR to their deployment and monitoring.

I have led key teams and projects, achieving significant improvements in quality and efficiency for large companies like Electronic Arts. I am seeking a senior role as a Data Scientist, ML Engineer, or Researcher where I can apply my technical vision and practical experience to solve complex problems.
